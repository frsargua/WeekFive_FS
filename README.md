# WeekFive_FS

## Description

The app allows the users to save, clear and update their notes on a daily basis. To achieve this I integrated local storage to locally save the notes during reloads.

- Pass notes are colored grey.
- Current notes are bordered blue.
- Future notes are green.

This project used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.
